     <h1>What to do during Lockdown</h1>

     <ol type='1' class="List">

       <li><b>Wash your hands frequently:</b> One can reduce the chances of getting infected by Coronavirus by frequently washing their hands. This should be done especially after touching potentially contaminated surfaces like doorknobs, railing of a staircase, shop counters, packages, letters, etc. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as well.</li><br>

       <li><b>Maintain cleanliness of the house:</b> It is important to clean and disinfect the house regularly. Normal household disinfectants like phenyl, or diluted bleach are effective against Coronavirus. Use a wipe or a mop dipped in a disinfecting solution to clean the floor, kitchen counters, etc. Make use of sanitizer sprays as well.</li><br>

       <li><b>Use face covers:</b> It is essential to cover your face when stepping out of the house in case of an emergency. A face cover will help both, you and other people. Using a medical-grade face cover is not mandatory to protect yourself from COVID-19. Homemade face covers should suffice.</li><br>

       <li><b>Eat healthily:</b> Eating a healthy diet will help maintain good health during the lockdown. You should take additional measures to eat nutritious food during this period. Include green leafy vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fruits, and fibre in your daily diet.</li><br>

       <li><b>Follow a routine:</b> The COVID-19 lockdown is keeping everyone confined to their homes for a long time. Remaining in your house can get quite boring. Thus, try to follow a routine that will keep you busy no matter how redundant it feels.</li><br>

     </ol>

     <h1>Things to Avoid during Lockdown</h1>

     <ol>

       <li><b>Don’t step out of the house:</b> It is quite understandable that people were used to stepping out of the house for work, shopping, or casual strolls. Meeting friends and visiting family regularly was also a norm. However, it is necessary that now these things should be avoided. By staying home, the spread of COVID-19 disease can be avoided. Thus, unless it is an emergency do not step out of the house.</li><br>

       <li><b>Don’t panic:</b> Recent events can be quite scary. With the number of COVID-19 cases increasing day by day, it is quite normal to feel anxious. Try to relax as panicking is not fruitful, on the contrary it can prove to be counter-productive. Remember that every dark cloud has a silvery lining and the Coronavirus pandemic will end soon.</li><br>

       <li><b>Don’t waste food or water:</b> This is the time to conserve resources like food and water as only these will take us through the lockdown. Wasting food will only result in empty containers and you would need to step out to buy more. Avoiding the wastage of food will help you remain in the house for a longer time.</li><br>

       <li><b>Don’t share unverified news:</b> With the internet and a large catalogue of news channels, a lot of unverified news is, unfortunately, being circulated regularly. Such news or rumours can lead to discouragement and panic among citizens. Avoid sharing anything that is not available on official sources.</li><br>

       <li><b>Don’t socialize:</b> A lockdown requires you to remain indoors. Thus, socializing even with the people in the close proximity of your house (e.g. neighbours) is not a good idea. A person may not show symptoms but could still be infected and pass COVID-19 to other people.</li><br>
